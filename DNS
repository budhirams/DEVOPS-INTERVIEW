What is DNS and why is it important? If networking is part of your job description, DNS is something interviewer cannot skip. So you can definitely expect a question on DNS. Let's say interviewer asks you this simple question, what is DNS and why is it important? Just explain the answer in short and crisp way. This is how I would answer. DNS is basically domain name system where it's just like internet phone book, just like how you have your telephone directory. DNS is like internet phone book that translates human friendly domain name, for example, google.com to an IP address. It's difficult to remember the IP addresses, so a domain name is set up by the company, by the website, so that you can actually call the website using the domain name. And then this request is translated to the IP address by DNS. So it's again a domain naming system. Without DNS, we would have to remember and type IP address to visit the website. For example, you have to remember the IP address of Google, you have to remember IP address of Amazon. Is it easy to remember the IP address or is it easy to remember the domain names? Definitely it's easy to remember the names, that's why people go for domain names. So this is how you can explain DNS. In a nutshell, DNS is domain name system. It's just like an internet phone book that translates human friendly domain name to IP address. Thank you for watching.

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It works like the internet's phone book by translating human-friendly domain names (like google.com) into machine-friendly IP addresses (like 142.250.182.14). This is important because it's easier for us to remember names than IP addresses. Without DNS, we would need to remember the IP of every website we visit. In short, DNS makes the internet user-friendly by enabling name-to-IP resolution."
