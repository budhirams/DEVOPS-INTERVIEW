What is a public subnet? Public subnet is something that has access to the internet or accessible through the internet because it is configured with an internet gateway. So here, interviewer said junior DevOps engineer created private subnet accidentally. So good thing is that a subnet is created. All that you need to do, you need to change this to a public subnet. Now very simple, just head to the route table or head to the route of this subnet and add internet gateway as the destination. And that's it. This subnet will become a public subnet. Only thing here is that you should tell the interviewer an internet gateway should exist. If an internet gateway does not exist, then yeah, you know, you need to first set up the internet gateway and then you need to perform this activity.

One-liner answer for interviews:
"To fix it, attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC (if not already) and update the route table of the subnet to point 0.0.0.0/0 to the IGW. This will convert the private subnet into a public subnet."
