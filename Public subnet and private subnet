What is the difference between public subnet and private subnet? This is a very very simple interview question. You can just tell the interviewer, public subnet has route to the internet through internet gateway. So you will place any public facing applications. For example, your front end application which needs to be accessed by the client. Whereas private subnet does not have any direct access from the internet. So you place your secure applications like database within the private subnet. So private subnet is more secure when compared to public subnet. And within the public subnet you place applications like your front end application, load balancer, these kind of things. This is how you explain public subnet versus private subnet.
