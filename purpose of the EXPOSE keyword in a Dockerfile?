Question: What is the purpose of the EXPOSE keyword in a Dockerfile?

1. Clarify what EXPOSE does:

The EXPOSE keyword is just metadata.

It documents which port the containerized application is expected to listen on.

It does not actually publish the port to the host machine.



2. Clear the common confusion:

Many people think EXPOSE is used for publishing ports â€“ this is wrong.

To publish and map a container port to the host machine, you need the -p flag in docker run:

docker run -p 8080:80 image-name



3. How it is useful:

If someone reads your Dockerfile, they immediately know which port the application is using.

Tools like Docker Compose use this metadata to allow services to interact.

For example, if a backend needs to talk to a database on port 3306, Docker Compose reads the EXPOSE 3306 from the DB image and allows the backend to connect.

This makes service-to-service communication seamless
